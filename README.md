## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- Resizing svg's with CSS scale().
- z-index and absolute positioning to create element on top of another element.
- You can use a pseudo-class selector in combination with a selector of a nested element to style only that nested element.
